TODO:
- Add labels for NA values in categorical variables

- Check which numeric features are in fact nominal/ordinal instead of quantitative
- Create df masks for Categorical and Quantitative variables

- Identify which Categorical variables are Ordinal
- Identify which Ordinal variables can be transformed / treated as Interval

- Inspect X vs Y plots
- Inspect histograms
- Identify outliers
- Check correlations between Scale, Interval variables and Target variable

- PCA for Quantitative variables
- Choose Categorical variables based on theory and intuition
- Think how to reduce the number of categories when to many

- Think about interactions between binaries and Quantitative variables


TO CHECK:
- MoSold (month of sale: 1-12) - ordinal or interval?
- year - ordinal or interval?
- MiscVal - exception

WHAT CAN GO INTO LINEAR MODEL:
	- Scale & Interval variables
	- Binary variables
